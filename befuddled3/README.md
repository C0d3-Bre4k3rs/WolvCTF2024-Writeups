In this challenge we receive a befunge compiler, with the Flag in the top of the stack.  
We need to write befunge code under some restrictions, and get the flag.   

## Solution

I won't bother you much... It's the same as [the last one](https://github.com/C0d3-Bre4k3rs/WolvCTF2024-Writeups/tree/main/befuddled2), but we have less characters to work with. Our solution still applies :0
